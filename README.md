The best work is an analogue of the Moco Space web application. The app itself (https://www.mocospace.com/login). Source resources (https://github.com/Tair-X/Moco_Space_App_Frontend_Backend). It is a social network, with many rooms that you can join and start discussing the topic of your interest and provide a link to all your friends. You can communicate with others through public chats and private group chats. Connection is confidential, through a reliable messaging system. She and other works are presented in the Repositories tab.

My fastest app is an online movie theater on Next js. With a unique backend and a bunch of customized things about the front, is it interesting?
